Observed symptoms during initial testing of the HICANN chip:


* All correctly binded chips correctly performed:

	* read JTAG ID.

	* perform loopback test using JTAG bypass register

	* current draw proportional to Faraday PLL frequency divider setting
		-> PLL configuration OK
		-> BUT: Frequeny analysis of VDD (digital power) showed:
			- peak at PLL output frequency
			- ~ 4 times larger peak at f(pllout)/2
			- NO component at f(pllout)/4 which is the system clock 
			  driving the majority of the digital part's flip-flops

	* the only reasonable next step was to test the loopack funcitonality of
		the ARQ unuits using the JTAG interface. This test failed at clock frequencies
		from 5MHz to 250MHz.

	* Test now OK with the full 250MHz under these circumstances:
		- Floating Gate power ???
		- DNC_IF correctly powered. DI_VBIAS_LVDS tied to GND due to incomplete 
			test setup.
		- DNC_IF LVDS TX pins shorted to RX pins.
		- DNC_IF disabled using JTAG system enable command
		-> loopback on tag 0 and tag 1 ARQ unit OK.
