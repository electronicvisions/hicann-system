0. use script Iinit to initialize system. - sets board voltages, resets all rams and programs floating gates.

1. Experiment: Stimulation via fpga:
	1. use Istart to start tm_capo 
	2. press f to start fpga background
	3. use n to switch between different even neuron numbers, use F to change stimulus
	4. use A to enable playback from spike train file
	5. use s to stop playback
	6. use x to quit testmode

2. Experiment: Feedforward network
	1. use Istart to start tm_capo
	2. use a create network and stimulate first group using background generators on Hicann
	3. use n to switch between different even neuron numbers, use H to change stimulus
	4. use P collect spikes in fpga and print them into a file. Testmode restart needed for a second pring!!!!
	5. change to python console and print spikes usin execfile("plot.py") (start ipython using script Ipy in bin folder)
		Neuron -2 is background for dll locking
		Neuron -1 is stimulus for group 1 and background for dll locking
		Groups: 1: Neuron 0:7
			2: Neuron 8:15
			3: Neuron 16:24
			4: Neuron 25:32
		Each neuron from group 1 fires on each neuron in group 2 and so on.
		No all firig: Not completely calibrated/ hand calibrated
	6. Maybe repeat experiment to show results to differen stimulus

3. Experiment: Single neuron demo using gui
	1. use Igui to start interface	
	2. use presed stuff and apply to programm neurons
	3. use Change current stimulus button to switch current on
	4. do not use synaptic stimulus!
